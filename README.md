# 👋 Hi, I'm Jerónimo Martínez

## Who am I?  
I'm a **Data Scientist** with a strong focus on designing intelligent solutions through data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. My background combines logical thinking, experience in education, and a passion for turning data into real-world decisions.

I trained at the **Henry** bootcamp, where I developed projects involving EDA, predictive models, recommendation systems, and interactive dashboards. Since then, I've been refining my skills in building complete architectures that integrate information retrieval, automated classification, and generative models (LLMs).

## 🌟 What do I do?

I'm currently designing and building solutions that integrate:
- Document processing and semantic retrieval (FAISS + embeddings)  
- Automated classification with trained models (scikit-learn)  
- Answer generation using **LLMs like Gemini 1.5**  
- Pipeline orchestration using **LangChain**, YAML, and dynamic workflows  
- Dashboards and query interfaces using **Streamlit** and REST APIs  
- Collaborative projects following the **Scrum methodology**

## 🚀 Where am I headed?

I'm aiming to apply artificial intelligence in business, education, and automation solutions. I seek to contribute to projects that create real impact by combining data, technology, and strategic thinking. I'm also currently diving into **project management (PMP)**.
